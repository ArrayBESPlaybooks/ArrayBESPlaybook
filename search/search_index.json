The aim of this new discipline was to establish more reliable practices and methods to deliver user-centered software solutions, putting aside biases in the way project teams imagine user needs to create a more firm foundation of evidence upon which to base design decisions. The practices and methods offered by the User Experience discipline ultimately help create greater efficiency on the project team while promoting greater effectiveness and satisfaction among end users. Studies consistently reinforce these benefits. A frequently cited report by IEEE states that: 70% of projects fail due to lack of user acceptance Investment in User Experience results in 33\u201350% reduced development time by having better upfront definition of requirements and avoiding rework Every dollar invested in UX brings 100 dollars in return Among the most common factors for project failure are: Unrealistic or unarticulated project goals Inaccurate estimates of needed resources Badly defined system requirements\u00b4 Poor communication among customers, developers and users Inability to handle the project\u2019s complexity User Experience is the key to addressing many of these factors. A well-defined User Experience process can help to establish and clarify project goals, balancing the needs of the people and organizations that stand to benefit most from digital products. The process also helps validate and refine system requirements by facilitating their analysis through the lens of user value, organizational value and complexity, identifying and resolving areas of ambiguity prior to the initiation of development cycles. These benefits leads to stronger project plans, better estimation and increased chances for project success. The USAF is unique in its challenges and opportunities as they relate to incorporating User Experience practices and methods within its daily operations.

In addition, these software systems support highly mission-critical operations where effectiveness cannot be compromised. This makes the effort associated with updating legacy systems and modernizing practices much more challenging and sensitive than are typically found. However these factors also reinforce the need to make these changes, taking advantage of better technological capabilities and User Experience practices that yield greater effectiveness across the organization and its workforce, ensuring greater success and reliability for these mission-critical operations.

Defined broadly, \u201cUser Experience\u201d is about how people experience and interact with an organization\u2019s varied products, systems and services. The focus of the User Experience craft is typically on interactive, digital experiences, but UX practitioners tend to take a broader, more holistic view, looking not only at a given product or service itself but at its users\u2019 expectations and the context in which it is used \u2013 which can include other products, non-digital communications and even people with whom the user communicates while using a product or service. This holistic view yields insights that help us to design digital experiences that fit more seamlessly into users\u2019 lives while helping them achieve more successful and satisfactory outcomes. In many cases, the insights and recommendations uncovered by the UX process can extend to those very same people and non-digital communications that surround an experience as well. 2.1.1 The \u201cThree Circles\u201d of User Experience This holistic focus is conveyed well via the classic \u201cThree Circles\u201d diagram first proposed by Peter Morville, considered one of the \u201cfounding fathers\u201d of the modern UX field: The meaning of each circle in this diagram is as follows: Content : This refers not just to images and copy, but to all the content, features and functions that comprise the experience. It\u2019s important to ensure that all aspects of the experience are included thoughtfully and purposefully to serve the needs of the system\u2019s users. Context : This refers to all of the external factors that a user may consider or encounter while using a given product, system or service. These factors vary greatly depending on the system and can include anything from distractions in the environment, to the device on which the experience is viewed, to other tools and systems that a system\u2019s user might be using simultaneously. Users : This refers to the people who use a given product, system or service. In most cases, the goal is to move beyond a singular, demographic-driven view of the user to establish a more nuanced understanding of distinct user profiles along with the unique needs, mindset, motivations, behaviors and limitations of each one. A deep understanding of the needs and context for each user profile results in more insightful design solutions that align more closely with the way that the system\u2019s users think and work. 2.1.2 Important Qualities of User Experience Usability is often the first aspect that comes to mind when considering the focus of user experience, but there are in actuality a number of other factors that UX practitioners take into account when shaping a product, system or service. This is captured well by another classic model created by Peter Morville: Each hexagon within this Honeycomb diagram is defined as follows: Useful : This refers to the relevance of content and features within a given system to its users. Content and features on a given interface are typically positioned and emphasized based on their level of usefulness or relevance in relation to other content on the screen. Usable : This refers to the ease of use of a given product or service, which includes the clarity of how features are presented as well as how reliably they behave. Desirable : This refers to emotional aspects of a system\u2019s design, which can include not only the sense of satisfaction experienced when a system aligns seamlessly with the users\u2019 needs, but also whether the organizational values reflected in the design resonate with those of the system\u2019s users. Findable : This means ensuring that navigation and content are designed and positioned in ways that are intuitive to end-users, allowing them to quickly find what they need in the places where they might expect to find them. Accessible : This means ensuring that products and services are usable for people with disabilities, which can include anything from hearing or vision impairment to color-blindness. Credible : This means designing so that users can feel that they can trust and rely on the information being presented within an experience, having confidence in the data integrity and system status presented therein. Valuable : This means ensuring that a product or service effectively advances the goals of the organization that sponsors it, whether the nature of those goals is educational, operational or otherwise. UX practitioners can design more effective digital experiences through careful and balanced consideration of these factors.

Everyone from developers to program managers to visual designers and content creators must take into account how their decisions might affect the experience of the system\u2019s users. But for those who specialize in user experience, the core disciplines that comprise their skillset might be summarized as follows: User Research : A truly user-centered design cannot be delivered without first assembling a sufficient body of research on the system\u2019s target users. This research can consist of quantitative data such as analytics, or qualitative insights gained from observing or interviewing current or potential users. Experience Strategy : Once the users\u2019 needs, expectations and challenges are well understood, those insights must then be synthesized and reconciled with the goals of the organization sponsoring the experience. This means ensuring that the value the organization is looking to provide aligns with the value the system\u2019s users seek. Once the core values driving the experience are established, those can then be used as the foundation for determining what kinds of content and features should be incorporated and how they should be prioritized, then translated into strategically-driven product roadmaps and other plans that lay a clear path to realizing value for both the users of a system and the organization that sponsored its creation. Information Architecture : This discipline entails organizing information within an experience in a way that is meaningful and intuitive to users. Prior to beginning screen designs, UX practitioners spend time considering the structure of the experience and the relationships between different types of content within it. They consider where features and content should fall within that structure in order to meet users\u2019 needs. This typically results in maps of the system\u2019s architecture and key processes within it, and often extends to content strategy documentation that outlines what content can be reused or refined versus what needs to be newly created. Interaction Design : Once user research, experience strategy and information architecture (IA) have been established, UX practitioners can then begin designing screens within the experience to align with established needs and goals. Content and features are incorporated into user interfaces (UI) that align with the target devices through which an experience will be accessed. At this point, the presentation and behavior of all interactive elements such as buttons, controls, transitions and animations are defined and documented in detail to prepare for technical implementation of the system. 2.2.1 Planning User Experience Teams While personnel from all disciplines share some level of responsibility for delivering products that meet user needs, at least one User Experience specialist should be incorporated within each software development team. This ensures that end users have clear and consistent advocacy within the software development lifecycle, uninhibited by conflicting objectives that may be held by developers, visual designers, program managers and others that may be involved in project delivery. The balance of these roles helps to ensure that each one\u2019s objectives become transparent in the planning and execution of the design, yielding better communication and decision-making overall. Specializations do exist for each of the separate core disciplines outlined above, however many User Experience professionals carry a sufficient balance of these skills to effectively manage all of them at once. A strong User Experience practitioner will be skilled in user research methods, navigation structure and process analysis in addition to interaction design. The more senior-level practitioners will be proficient in product strategy and planning, and should be involved by Program Management teams at the earliest stages of a project\u2019s conception to ensure the right research, design and testing approach through all stages of the project. Enlisting strong UX generalists rather than specialized research and design functions is generally more cost-effective, and will help to maintain a cohesive product vision while ensuring a high degree of consistency, adaptability and agility within a dynamic project environment. While User Experience practitioners do establish the foundations for interface design, the craft of creating pixel-perfect page layouts are often managed by a separate Visual Design function who holds a much deeper understanding of factors such as color, typography and creative asset production. Some practitioners may have both skillsets, but considering these as separate functions will increase the likelihood of identifying talent that holds sufficient depth of experience, skill and perspective for each role. Similarly, while User Experience practitioners should be competent in prototyping and understanding the implications of technical factors identified by development teams, true front-end development skills should be considered a separate role within the project team.

Some practitioners may have both skillsets, but considering these as separate functions will increase the likelihood of identifying talent that holds sufficient depth of experience, skill and perspective for each role. Similarly, while User Experience practitioners should be competent in prototyping and understanding the implications of technical factors identified by development teams, true front-end development skills should be considered a separate role within the project team.","title":"2.2.1 Planning User Experience Teams"},{"location":"ux/2-2-disciplines/#references","text":"What Is User Experience (UX) Design?

Research & Discovery : This is the stage where initial research activities will be performed and insights will be synthesized based on the research findings. A high-level strategy should be established at this stage that includes experience goals, tactics, plans and content/feature recommendations which can then be used as a foundation for Conceptual Design. Conceptual Design : During this stage, key aspects of the experience will be modeled and discussed in order to establish alignment around the overall approach and design framework for the experience. The conceptual models produced during this stage can describe things like site architecture, processes, navigation patterns and key page layouts to help lay the foundations for an efficient Detailed Design process. A key goal of this stage is to establish clear expectations about how a digital experience will be presented at a high level in order to minimize the need for significant rework in the future. Detailed Design : Once foundations for the experience have been established, the Detailed Design stage then builds on those foundations, designing and specifying detailed elements and interactions for each section and component of the experience. This provides the basis for visual design comps to be created in addition to a clear and detailed plan that developers can follow in order to implement the experience. Support : During this stage, UX practitioners play a supporting role to the visual design and technical development teams who are producing the experience. This can involve addressing questions to clarify intended interactive behaviors, revising designs to resolve technical implementation challenges, and assisting with the testing and delivery of the implemented experience. These stages can sometimes be named or broken down differently, but in essence outline the stages of a typical user experience process. However it is important to note that some of these stages may not be required at times depending on the nature and goals of the project. For example, if a project entails targeted refinements and enhancements to an existing experience, full Research/Discovery and Conceptual Design stages may not be needed; however in this scenario, some level of user input should be collected and reviewed in order to determine what refinements should be made. Similarly, a Conceptual Design stage can in some case proceed without a Research/Discovery stage, assuming that existing research sufficiently addresses key questions relevant to the design problem at hand. The approach to planning and managing each of these stages can vary considerably depending on the software development process leveraged by the project team as a whole, described in further detail below. 2.3.1 Waterfall Process Considerations In a \u201cwaterfall\u201d process, each of these stages happens in sequential order, with the output of each stage being typically reviewed, finalized and approved in its entirety before proceeding to the next stage. In this type of process methodology, the typical expectation is that all documentation is comprehensive and exhaustive, addressing all possible questions and scenarios prior to any development being performed. Representative members of each project team can be incorporated into each stage to ensure that proper communication occurs and relevant questions are identified early in the process, but often this is not the case in a classic waterfall process. Instead, each project team often works independently from each other, with the resulting documentation being tossed \u201cover the wall\u201d so to speak to other project teams in order to guide their efforts for the next process stage. The main advantage of this approach is the upfront clarity and stability of plans and specifications prior to the beginning of technical implementation. However there are several disadvantages to the waterfall approach: Reduced communication and collaboration between project teams Heavy and often unwieldy design documentation Longer overall project timelines Working software not available for evaluation until late in the project lifecycle Inflexibility to changing requirements and circumstances surrounding the project Cross-team communication challenges can sometimes be circumvented in a waterfall process through adopting daily \u201cstand-up\u201d or \u201cscrum\u201d meeting that are typical in an Agile process; however daily scrum meetings alone do not make a project truly \u201cAgile, and leave many of the other disadvantages of the Waterfall methodology unaddressed. 2.3.2 Agile Process Considerations The Agile methodology was devised in order to address many of these disadvantages of waterfall processes. However the classic Agile methodology focuses more so on technical development aspects and less so on user experience or design aspects of the software development lifecycle. In order for user experience and design teams to work efficiently and effectively within the process, some additional process considerations must be made. The core Agile values are what remain consistent regardless of project role or the type of Agile process being employed. These core values are: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools Working software over comprehensive documentation Customer collaboration over contract negotiation Responding to change over following a plan Putting these values into context, things like plans, processes, tools and documentation are still relied upon heavily in an Agile environment, however all of these are secondary to effective communication, collaboration and adaptability among members of the project team. As such, there are many crucial \u201cceremonies\u201d that also remain consistent within an Agile process, playing a key role in ensuring that the values and benefits of the Agile methodology are realized. A daily \u201cscrum\u201d or \u201cstandup\u201d meeting is a one type of Agile ceremony that ensures that team members across disciplines have a daily view of what features are in focus today and what key challenges might impact their completion. Teams typically work from a \u201cproduct backlog\u201d \u2013 a prioritized list of all features and capabilities that will ultimately be part of the final experience \u2013 and break that product backlog down into \u201csprints\u201d, typically 2 weeks in duration, where a portion of the items from the backlog are expected to be complete. As changes occur or new requirements are realized, this product backlog is continually \u201cgroomed\u201d to ensure that the project plan is optimized for the best outcome, and planning sessions at the start of each new sprint offer an opportunity to put the adjusted plan into effect. See the Agile Playbook for further details on typical Agile ceremonies, tools and methods. In addition to values and ceremonies, the Agile management framework is another aspect of the methodology that remains relatively unchanged when design teams are incorporated, however slight amendments must be made to define a clear role for User Experience. The Agile management framework identifies two key roles \u2013 the Scrum Master and the Product Owner \u2013 where the Scrum Master\u2019s primary role is to keep the project team focused on its goals for the sprint, and the Product Owner\u2019s primary role is to keep the team\u2019s work aligned with the overall product vision. While the Agile methodology does not directly prescribe a role for User Experience teams, their role is best considered as an extension to the Product Owner role. This means helping to establish the product context during the Research/Discovery stage, summarizing core user needs and business requirements. This also entails modeling the product vision during the Conceptual Design stage, creating preliminary wireframes and user stories that describe the expected user needs and behaviors that each feature of the experience will be designed to support. Lastly, this means leading the creation, prioritization and ongoing \u201cgrooming\u201d of the product backlog, ensuring that the most valuable features are delivered first and meet the expectations of the users for whom they are designed. As a project moves into detailed design, the task of backlog grooming is often shared with members of the Project Management team, with members of the UX team offering significant guidance while focusing mainly on the creation of design specifications for each item in the backlog. The aspect in which the classic Agile methodology is least prescriptive for User Experience teams is its guidance around planning each of the process stages and determining what user experience practices to incorporate within them. Many of the Agile ceremonies outlined above are more relevant to the Detailed Design and Support stages than they are to the initial Research/Discovery and Conceptual Design stages. In Agile terms, these first two stages are often combined and named \u201cSprint Zero\u201d, continuing to resemble a waterfall process in many ways. This allows for solid research foundations and a clear product vision to be established in advance of working iteratively on detailed design specifications. Cross-team input is valuable at any stage, and daily scrums may be incorporated to facilitate this, but beginning front-end development before a clear product vision is set can result in lost development cycles and a significant amount of rework. Design teams should focus first on establishing a clear product architecture and basic alignment around how features might be translated into layouts before the team begins iterations of detailed design and prototyping. Once a product backlog is created at the end of Conceptual Design, the project team is prepared to adopt all other typical Agile ceremonies for the remainder of the project. Detailed Design and Support are the stages where the Agile methodology is utilized in its truest form. In an ideal scenario, all project teams are focused on the same set of features at once, working in unison to arrive at a functioning prototype of a specific feature. User Experience teams leads their counterparts through the iterative process for each feature: Understanding and clarifying requirements Defining key criteria for the design solution based user needs, business goals and technology capabilities Exploring different design solutions that meet the requirements and criteria Deciding which solution to pursue based on input from across team functions Prototyping the solution Testing, validating and potentially refining the solution This constant communication and direct translation of designs into working code can significantly reduce the amount documentation created or needed within a project, a documentation approach often referred to as \u201cLean\u201d wherein design specifications are only as exhaustive as necessitated by the project team. In an ideal Agile scenario where all teams can focus on the same set of features at once, the cycle described above can take anywhere from 2-5 days to complete, assuming that cross-disciplinary teams are well-integrated and that features in the product backlog are broken into small, manageable chunks that are achievable within that time frame. By the end of the sprint, the expectation is that all backlog items that have been initiated are completed, reviewed and approved, however selective items can move into later sprints if necessary. 2.3.3 UX Process at Different Stages of the \u201cAgility Spectrum\u201d However some organizations may have difficulty achieving this level of integration, and even then, readiness for these methods may vary between different teams or projects within an organization, falling at different points of the \u201cagility spectrum\u201d. The approach to planning the Detailed Design stage may vary depending on the degree of \u201cagility\u201d at which any given team or project is ready to operate. Limiting factors to project agility often go beyond the team or organization\u2019s level of training and experience, and can extend to project-specific factors such as resource availability, vendor involvement, project budget and ability to co-locate. In these scenarios, there are a number of ways that a project approach can be adjusted to ensure successful collaboration and delivery. One approach is to rely on a User Experience team\u2019s competency in creating clickable prototypes using software such as InVision, Sketch or Axure. This reduces reliance on the development team to arrive at a working model and significantly simplifies the level of effort required to produce it. Development teams still need to stay closely involved in its creation and will certainly have additional tasks to perform such as data sourcing and more complex interactivity, but creating clickable prototypes in software allows project teams to effectively validate the usability and flow of a given feature while enabling development teams to work independently and in parallel on those additional tasks. This also allows the user experience team to work at a faster velocity on a range of features while development teams work at their own pace determining the optimal implementation approach. The key here is ensuring that both teams have a portion of their velocity (typically 10-20% of available bandwidth) dedicated to addressing questions and collaborating across teams on different pieces of work. The length of each sprint is another variable to consider. While a 2-week sprint cycle is considered standard, lengthening that cycle to 3 or even 4 weeks can help ensure sprint objectives are successfully achieved. In the scenario described above where project teams spend some portion of their time working independently and in parallel, a longer sprint cycle can ensure that all teams have sufficient time to reconvene, discuss their findings and make adjustments so that all sprint output is delivered on time, with exhaustive validation and alignment across stakeholders, further reducing the potential need for rework throughout the project timeline. Another approach is to anticipate \u201cstaggered sprints\u201d from the outset. This means that the user experience team always working one full sprint ahead of the development team. To do this, the notion must be applied here of having each team\u2019s velocity account for a portion of time dedicate to collaborating across teams on different pieces of work. While it would be expected that the same staggered sprint duration would be maintained throughout the project lifecycle, this approach does allow one team to stay on track with delivery in the event that another team faces challenges with maintaining that pace. The need for additional time to work through complex issues is a common challenge for development teams, but can be a challenge for user experience teams as well. If this type of challenge is foreseen during the project\u2019s planning activities, something called a \u201cdesign spike\u201d can be instituted to alleviate this issue. A design spike is an activity that can take place of a regular sprint to resolve big unknowns and work through complexities that would otherwise impact the efficiency of the project team. During this time, development teams are typically assigned non-dependent work while the user experience team gathers additional requirements and potential explore concepts for specific feature areas within the product. While these practices may not be considered Agile in its truest form, they may become essential in managing a team successfully through limiting factors to agility such as resource availability, vendor involvement, project budget and ability to co-locate. These practices might also be considered stepping stones to more advanced and integrated Agile practices, enabling project teams to abide by the value and reap the benefits of the Agile methodology while ensuring project plans and output are optimized for success. 2.3.4 Practical Considerations When planning a project or estimating work that involves a User Experience component within an Agile setting, there are a few key guidelines or common practices to consider. One common practice is aligning team size and levels across disciplines. A general rule of thumb is to match every user experience designer with a visual designer and a front-end developer, also taking the levels of seniority and team hierarchy into account. This helps to ensure that the output of one team aligns with the production capacity of other teams on the project. This may require adjustment based on project-specific factors, but is often a good place to start. This rule of thumb does not typically apply to project management or back-end technology functions, who each have unique considerations to take into account when estimating team size. Another common practice is ensuring that separate user stories are written for user experience versus technology teams. There may be significant overlap or even replication of stories between teams but this is not always the case. For one thing, development teams have different considerations to make when estimating the level of effort associated with a user story, which can result in the development effort associated with a story being much larger than the design effort. In these cases, user stories may be decomposed into smaller, more manageable stories from a development perspective. Likewise, development teams often approach work differently from an efficiency standpoint, resulting in a different view of how user stories should be structured. For example, user experience stories are typically focused on the front-end experience, but many features may have a significant back-end component in common, resulting in greater development efficiency if those stories are in some way grouped together. The vast majority of user stories will be shared across both teams, but there are frequently cases where differentiating a handful of these stories will result in a more efficient development process. One final consideration is around estimating the \u201csize\u201d or level of effort associated with a user story. While any design problem may have a number of viable solutions, the Conceptual Design stage helps narrow down the range of possible solutions which in turn makes estimation easier. On this basis, the User Experience team should first discuss what successful completion of each user story might entail, then determine how complex and time-consuming the delivery of that solution might be. To approximate and track this, each item in the product backlog is often assigned a number from the Fibonacci sequence (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.) which represents the complexity of the design problem in increasing orders of magnitude. These \u201cstory points\u201d are often used to track a team\u2019s velocity, with a baseline established in the first sprint as to how many story points the User Experience team can successfully deliver. Particularly large values are usually an indication that a story needs to be decomposed into smaller, more manageable stories, particularly when those values are higher than the baseline velocity that an individual team member can deliver in one sprint. These story point values can be taken into account when planning what items to take into a sprint, and can be adjusted at the start of each sprint as new requirements or complexities are learned. Further details about each stage of the User Experience process, including the key methods and activities conducted at each stage, will be outlined in the UX Principles & Methodologies section of this playbook.

To approximate and track this, each item in the product backlog is often assigned a number from the Fibonacci sequence (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.) which represents the complexity of the design problem in increasing orders of magnitude. These \u201cstory points\u201d are often used to track a team\u2019s velocity, with a baseline established in the first sprint as to how many story points the User Experience team can successfully deliver. Particularly large values are usually an indication that a story needs to be decomposed into smaller, more manageable stories, particularly when those values are higher than the baseline velocity that an individual team member can deliver in one sprint. These story point values can be taken into account when planning what items to take into a sprint, and can be adjusted at the start of each sprint as new requirements or complexities are learned. Further details about each stage of the User Experience process, including the key methods and activities conducted at each stage, will be outlined in the UX Principles & Methodologies section of this playbook.","title":"2.3.4 Practical Considerations"},{"location":"ux/2-3-lifecycle/#references","text":"Agile Manifesto https://agilemanifesto.org Scrum https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum Design Sprint Kit https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/introduction/overview Benefits of Partnering Closely with Your Product Owner https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2018/08/benefits-of-partnering-closely-with-your-product-owner.php A Spectrum of Approaches to Project Agility https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/learning/thought-leadership/achieving-greater-agility-series/spectrum-approaches.pdf Spikes https://www.scaledagileframework.com/spikes Fitting Big-Picture UX Into Agile Development https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/design-spikes-fit-big-picture-ux-agile-development","title":"References"},{"location":"ux/3-1-principles/","text":"3.1 UX Principles Establishing anchoring user experience principles allows us a mechanism to instill consistency across the breadth of USAF Logistics Information Systems\u2019 portfolio. These principles represent goals at a high, abstract level of the user\u2019s experience, but should be reflected in the design and execution of specific capabilities wherever applicable. In this way, we can know that even where specific interactions and interface components will differ per the respective requirements of a given system, as long as they are successfully fulfilling the same larger UX principle, an overarching consistency of purpose, experience, and mission support is being met. Referring to these principles consistently over time offers decision-making guidance, from strategic efforts (e.g. prioritizing features) to tactical execution (e.g. determining specific interactions and system flows). To best serve the logistics community and its missions, systems should adhere to the following eight interrelated UX principles: 3.1.1 Enable Clear and Immediate Decision Support Paramount to a system\u2019s ability to support its mission is highly effective user enablement, especially for logistics information systems in the area of decision-making. To that end, a system\u2019s design should first and foremost support this critical function. Proper enablement includes: Intuitive and easily repeatable task flows for arriving at decision-supporting information. Formatting and presenting decision-supporting information in a way that facilitates subsequent steps (either within or outside of the system). Providing appropriate descriptions, context, and caveats with data to better inform decision-making. Favoring recognition over recall by the user. The user can select from clearly presented options instead of recalling codes or meanings. Options are reduced to only those that are applicable in context. Plain-text descriptions are offered wherever data is coded. All of this requires that users and their key tasks and decisions are understood deeply by the system owners and designers. 3.1.2 Promote Data Integrity and Accuracy Data lies at the heart of logistics information systems and processes. Faithful representation and management of this data, then, is crucial to mission success for their users. For users to have confidence in a system\u2019s data, they must understand how the system works. Further, a policy of data transparency will improve the data\u2019s accuracy over time and build trust in its systems. Enterprise-wide data integrity and accuracy can be ensured by: Never obscuring or correcting problematic source data. Instead, at a minimum, intend to notify the user of possible issues and, optimally, offer means to resolving issues. Indicating from where data is sourced and, where relevant, the business logic applied by the system to create the displayed data. Minimizing the possibility of human error. Use structured inputs wherever possible, reduce options to only those that are allowable by business rules, and offer rich type-ahead suggestions where a user needs more open-ended data entry or query. This principle requires system owners and designers to have thorough expertise in relevant technical orders and their system\u2019s contributing source systems. 3.1.3 Streamline Common Tasks and Analyses Making common tasks and analyses more efficient for the end user allows the system to maximize its value to the user and to the mission overall. The system\u2019s design should favor its users\u2019 most frequent needs by streamlining its flows and interfaces toward those ends. Some means toward that goal include: Emphasizing most commonly used functions. Allowing users to individually save settings, custom searches, and tool preferences. Providing smart defaults wherever possible. This ranges from pre-selecting the most common form field options to displaying the most commonly used features or sections upon initial login. Successfully following this principle requires comprehensively researching your users\u2019 intents and monitoring system usage. 3.1.4 Tailor Tasks and Interfaces to Roles Too often, DoD systems err by attempting to do everything for everyone, and by doing so, ultimately impede the mission. Offering users the right content and functionality for their needs and assignments is a meaningful way to support the above UX principles, but also to aid mission attainment. Ways to tailor the experience include: Emphasizing or exposing interfaces or portions of interfaces, especially for data entry and transactional functions, to only those user roles with a need and authority for said functionality. Designing task flows and interfaces so that they at a minimum support, but optimally increase the efficiency of, the larger assignment beyond the system for key end-user groups. Reducing data inputs, and options within those inputs, to only those that are meaningful and relevant to the user\u2019s role and their current context. 3.1.5 Provide Clear System Status Clear, consistent status indication and feedback is a certain measure for instilling trust in users and providing a sense of confidence and control within the system. With this sense of control, users do not have to split their attention between managing the system and contextualizing its responses and outputs, and can instead focus entirely on quickly and accurately accomplishing their end goal. A system should clearly report its status by: Indicating the recency and providing a detailed status of its source systems. Providing up-to-date context for the content and data presented by the system. Utilizing consistent enterprise metaphors for indicating status, such as stoplight coloring, at both the system and individual data record levels. Telling the user when it is busy processing their request, and, if the response is expected to take longer than a few seconds, offering an indication of how much longer the response will take or what percent of the process is complete. 3.1.6 Prioritize Alerts and Exceptions As the nature of many tasks within the logistics community includes attending to conspicuous, outlying data and \u201cgreening up\u201d problem areas, many users can greatly benefit by having these situations brought to their attention systematically, instead of by someone up or down the chain of command, or by hunting through data themselves. Where appropriate then, systems should prioritize alerts and exceptions to support this type of task by: Alerting users where problems may exist in the source data or in calculations made by the system with uncertain source data. Highlighting metrics that are below target goals, limits, or enterprise standards. Offering deeper assessments with explanations, breakdowns, or drivers of metrics and calculations. 3.1.7 Ensure Fast Findability Due to the inherent urgency of some mission support tasks, systems should be designed to allow users to quickly find information. Some means to assist this include: Providing smart defaults on interface configurations and search parameters. Tailoring data reports to include unrequested but meaningful supporting data alongside the user\u2019s requested information, sparing the user a second query or deeper analysis. Allowing users to individually save settings, custom searches, and tool preferences. Adhering to visual design best practices for clear presentation of content and data. 3.1.8 Reduce Reliance on Externalities Fragmented experiences are too often the norm, whether it be requiring users to jump between systems, or referencing paper documents or print materials. Pulling as much information and as many sub-tasks as makes sense into a user\u2019s primary system of need can consolidate work and reduce fragmentation. The end result is an allowance for the user to give more attention to their actual end goals and less on managing tools, thereby supporting the above principles of faster, more streamlined decision-making. Providing plain-text descriptions of acronyms and codes. Optimizing system task flows to seamlessly fit into larger external processes. Digitizing paper processes, especially where immediate transcription back into a digital system is expected.","title":"3.1 UX Principles"},{"location":"ux/3-1-principles/#31-ux-principles","text":"Establishing anchoring user experience principles allows us a mechanism to instill consistency across the breadth of USAF Logistics Information Systems\u2019 portfolio.

There are different types of interviews, each serving a different purpose. When to use Use interviews to examine users, subject matter experts or stakeholders closely, especially to: Investigate more deeply into users\u2019 needs or behaviors, e.g. motivations, expectations, concerns, and frustrations. Gain subject-matter expertise on mission current state, best practices, and problem articulation. Understand mission objectives, current opportunities and obstacles, and project success criteria. Requirements Access to actual end users. (User proxies, or representatives, can be helpful, but frequently do not have a full picture of real end users\u2019 process, context or usage scenarios.) Ability to record and transcribe later, or have a second team member listening for note taking. (It is generally inefficient to lead the interview while also taking notes.) Variations Contextual/field study versus direct discussion Contextual interviews are conducted in the environment in which the user would typically interact with your system (e.g. at their workplace), and generally involves the participant allowing the interviewer to watch them use the system for actual purposes (i.e. while \u201cdoing their day job\u201d). This method allows the interviewer to learn, from direct observation, about details that frequently go unaccounted for, or unremembered by the user when out of setting, such as necessary supplemental materials (e.g. a field manual kept next to the computer). It also allows for pain points that have been normalized by the user over time to be noticed and discussed. Inviting a participant to a direct session (either away from the user\u2019s work station or even just via a dedicated phone call or online meeting) can remove the burden and distraction of routine job obligations and keep the focus on your topics. Group versus individual Interviewing a large group of users together is best used to get a wide range of input quickly and a shallow exploration of the problem space. This method is best done as an initial session, prior to breaking out individual or small-group interviews. In individual interviews, topics can be explored in depth, without concern for a \u201cloudest voice\u201d or highest ranking presence inhibiting equitable input. Structured versus unstructured Structured interviews should be used when you have a specific set of questions to be addressed with your participant, especially when the ability to compare responses between multiple participants is desired. In unstructured interviews the topics are only broadly laid out. The interviewer does much more listening than interacting, sometimes speaking only to prompt the participant to continue or explain something further. These interviews are effective when the desire is to cover touchy subjects without directly asking about them, or to probe deeper emotional reactions by offering a neutral, safe conversational space.

An effective IA allows users to find information and complete tasks efficiently. Scheme refers to how content is categorized or segmented. Schemes can either be objective (e.g. alphabetical, or chronological), or subjective (e.g. by topic, or by audience type). Structure refers to the relationship between content. Two common structures are hierarchical (top-down), where initial categories are broad, and lead to more specific later categories; and sequential, where content is presented along a linear progression. Methods Cardsorting In this method, participants organize topics into categories that make sense to them. In an open card sort, the participants can assign their own labels to their groupings. In a closed sort, participants are only allowed to categorize within set categories. This method is an effective means of identifying or validating an appropriate topical architecture scheme. Tree testing To validate a hierarchical structure for your content, use tree testing. In this test, a participant is asked to choose a path along the hierarchy, or \u201ctree,\u201d they would follow in order to find a given piece of information. Practical considerations Consider long-term implications of your architecture. Future content additions should be easily placeable within the architecture.

In much the same fashion as earlier testing, however, participants should be given scenarios or tasks, and asked to complete them through use of the prototyped interfaces, while also thinking aloud to express their thoughts and feelings of the experience as they proceed. Requirements A test script based on real scenarios or use cases . A prototype that allows for the completion of the tasks in the test script. The ability to recruit target end users to participate. An ability to record the tests, or to take careful notes during the sessions. Variations Moderated versus unmoderated With moderated testing, a moderator sits with the participant to guide the session. This involves giving the participant an introduction to the test and its goals, then giving tasks to the tester as the session progresses, prompting the user to explain their thoughts and actions, and helping prevent the tester from getting completely off track. In this method, the moderator must be careful to avoid offering any guidance on how to complete the test tasks, even if the tester begs off a difficult task, until the entire test is done. If the tester has veered so far off as to make their continuation unproductive, the moderator may elect to gently direct the tester to start over or move to the next task. The moderator must also be extremely careful not to ask leading or biased questions about the design in an attempt to elicit specific feedback. The moderator should exhibit neutral attitudes regarding the design and the test tasks. In unmoderated testing, the efficacy of the test relies on the participants to clearly understand the goals of the test and their instructions for properly participating, including a desire to have them continuously thinking aloud for the duration of the session. Because that behavior is fairly unnatural, it is easily forgotten about when attempting a particularly challenging task, which is exactly when that vocalization is most beneficial to the design team. Unmoderated testing is typically done via an online testing tool, where the test can be done at the participant\u2019s convenience on their own computer, which makes participation easier. Formal versus informal/guerilla In formal testing, the test is conducted in a lab setting with a moderator on hand to lead the sessions. In highly formal lab settings, there is frequently an observation area separated from the test area by a one-way mirror. This keeps the participant and moderator able to focus on the test, while allowing stakeholders and other team members to observe the sessions firsthand. Formal settings often have advanced technologies for recording the test, including video of the participant, screen capture of the participant\u2019s on-screen actions, and even eye tracking. In this way, formal tests can yield highly nuanced findings. Informal or guerilla-style testing is conducted in any environment where testers can find participants. This can be simply at the participant\u2019s desk, or a conference room. The test need not be conducted in a highly controlled setting in order to elicit meaningful feedback. Product/output Ideally, your setup allows for a recording of the test sessions (most importantly audio recording and screen capture) for later analysis and detailed reporting. If that is not possible, having someone available to take notes during the sessions, such as key quotes from the testers and details around specific difficulties, will suffice. The findings should inform iterations of the detailed designs and prototype, and a repeat of testing until the designs satisfy user needs. Practical considerations Make sure the test participants are made aware that they are not being tested \u2013 the effectiveness of the design is. Any difficulty the participant has completing the test script is a reflection of a deficient design, not of their abilities. If recording is not available, make sure there is a second person available to take notes. The moderator should be able to focus on the participant and their test tasks, not on documenting findings.

This involves giving the participant an introduction to the test and its goals, then giving tasks to the tester as the session progresses, prompting the user to explain their thoughts and actions, and helping prevent the tester from getting completely off track. In this method, the moderator must be careful to avoid offering any guidance on how to complete the test tasks, even if the tester begs off a difficult task, until the entire test is done. If the tester has veered so far off as to make their continuation unproductive, the moderator may elect to gently direct the tester to start over or move to the next task. The moderator must also be extremely careful not to ask leading or biased questions about the design in an attempt to elicit specific feedback. The moderator should exhibit neutral attitudes regarding the design and the test tasks. In unmoderated testing, the efficacy of the test relies on the participants to clearly understand the goals of the test and their instructions for properly participating, including a desire to have them continuously thinking aloud for the duration of the session. Because that behavior is fairly unnatural, it is easily forgotten about when attempting a particularly challenging task, which is exactly when that vocalization is most beneficial to the design team. Unmoderated testing is typically done via an online testing tool, where the test can be done at the participant\u2019s convenience on their own computer, which makes participation easier.","title":"Moderated versus unmoderated"},{"location":"ux/3-5-1-3-usability/#formal-versus-informalguerilla","text":"In formal testing, the test is conducted in a lab setting with a moderator on hand to lead the sessions.

There are many other types of controls (radio buttons, inline scrolls, dropdown menus, etc.), but these most frequently adopt the style of the browser itself, and are thus excluded. Additional styled elements (like navigation and breadcrumbs) can be found within the Component Library of this playbook. Buttons Buttons are a key component of interaction design, and are often the primary call-to-action at the page and component level. They usually \u201ccommit\u201d the action of a user \u2013 submitting a form or piece of data, opening / closing a page element, or navigating to a new content section. Buttons should adhere to the following best practices: Buttons should look like buttons. Unlike links \u2013 which are often just highlighted text \u2013 buttons employ a containing element (usually a square or rounded rectangle) to look like the buttons of the physical world. This helps increase their visual emphasis in a layout, and communicate their clickability. Buttons should be findable. The button location should be logical in relation to the actions of the layout. A \u201csubmit\u201d button, for instance, should be readily visible as the user is completing the last required field of a form. A \u201cnext\u201d button should live near the end of a content section (or universally accessible, if the content is intended to be scanned and not read to completion). Buttons placement should never be a hunting game. Buttons should communicate their action. Button labels should be clear and obvious, indicating the behavior of the button. \u201cSubmit form,\u201d \u201cLearn More,\u201d and \u201cNext\u201d articulate the intention of the button, and relate directly to the content around it. Furthermore, combining buttons labels and buttons styles \u2013 such as in the case with a \u201cCancel\u201d button and an adjacent \u201cOK\u201d button -- enhances the clarity of each button\u2019s action. Button Emphasis & States Buttons often come in primary and secondary styles, both of which follow call-to-action color rules but are treated differently to communicate priority and emphasis. In this case, a primary button style might be used to submit a form, while a secondary button style might be used to cancel the form submission. As interactive elements, buttons often have multiple states to communicate to the user the status of the button. Commonly these states are active, hover (on desktop) / clicked, and disabled. The disabled button state is particularly useful for compelling the user to provide all mandatory data before they can proceed; once all form fields have been completed, the button changes to an active \u2013 thus clickable \u2013 state. Styling custom buttons should follow your application\u2019s design guidelines, and the rules of contrast, legibility, and color mentioned elsewhere in this playbook. The basic button states follow a complementary logic: The active button state reflects the call-to-action color, improving the obviousness of its function. The hover state is a slightly lighter or darker than the active state, further communicating that it is an interactive element. The disabled state is desaturated and reduced in opacity; ideally, it is just visible enough to discern as a button, but not distract from the other active page elements. Button Feedback As a key site interaction, users often want validation that their button-click has performed the intended operation. In some cases, loading the subsequent page will be an adequate response to clicking \u201cLearn More.\u201d In others \u2013 such as when submitting a form \u2013 additional validation may be required. In these cases, consider confirmation and error message styles that are unique and explicit. These feedback elements are a perfect example of the interrelatedness of UX and visual design. Tabs Tabs are a common interactive element \u2013 especially within data tables \u2013 and communicate lateral movement between content of like categories. They are useful in navigation, and also in comparing similar content types on separate layouts. Combine in like categories . Tabbed items should live at the same hierarchical level with one another. They should also have mutually exclusive content. For example, if the tab category is \u201cmedia,\u201d individual tabs could be \u201cMusic,\u201d \u201cMovies,\u201d and \u201cBooks.\u201d Arrange tabs in a logical order . The first (leftmost) tab in the set is usually the default tab, and thus sets the standard for content and behavior of other tabs. This tab should also feature your prioritized content, with less prioritized content as the user moves right. There are some exceptions, of course, such as in the case of tabs that are organized alphabetically or numerically. Mind horizontal space . Since tabs are usually bound by screen width (other than an infinite vertical scroll), your tab solution should be meaningful at the given device\u2019s viewport. That might mean a scalable tab set that goes \u201coffscreen,\u201d using truncated text, or switching from text to icons when users reach the mobile breakpoint. Tabs must maintain their meaning and scannability, at any scale. Similar to buttons and navigation elements, tabs often have states to communicate their status.

They are useful in navigation, and also in comparing similar content types on separate layouts. Combine in like categories . Tabbed items should live at the same hierarchical level with one another. They should also have mutually exclusive content. For example, if the tab category is \u201cmedia,\u201d individual tabs could be \u201cMusic,\u201d \u201cMovies,\u201d and \u201cBooks.\u201d Arrange tabs in a logical order . The first (leftmost) tab in the set is usually the default tab, and thus sets the standard for content and behavior of other tabs. This tab should also feature your prioritized content, with less prioritized content as the user moves right. There are some exceptions, of course, such as in the case of tabs that are organized alphabetically or numerically. Mind horizontal space . Since tabs are usually bound by screen width (other than an infinite vertical scroll), your tab solution should be meaningful at the given device\u2019s viewport. That might mean a scalable tab set that goes \u201coffscreen,\u201d using truncated text, or switching from text to icons when users reach the mobile breakpoint. Tabs must maintain their meaning and scannability, at any scale.

In some cases, mobile devices make up the majority of access. So while we can\u2019t yet dismiss the importance of desktop devices, it\u2019s a best practice to remember that our users first reach for the computers in their pockets. Mobile is Different Most visual design principles are universal, and applicable across devices. The elements of type and color and imagery employ the same best practices. But two key factors (and many smaller ones) require slightly different design thinking, and a real consideration of user experience. The device is in-hand . Mobile devices have small viewports, obviously. That smaller screen size means that longer copy and larger interactive elements need to be treated with a sort of shorthand. An icon, perhaps, where before there was icon and text. That viewport means a smaller keyboard with smaller keys. They\u2019re often thumb-typed, making long form entry uncomfortable. And to just shrink interactive elements fails the user \u2013 often resulted in the dreaded \u201cfat finger\u201d mis-tap. The user is on-the-go . Mobile access often indicates that the user isn\u2019t at their workstation, is in a remote working environment, or is even working \u201cmulti-screen.\u201d They may be using cellular data and thus reluctant to download large files, if they\u2019re able to at all. They may be in an \u201cin-between time,\u201d waiting in line or walking to their next meeting, hoping for the most efficient task completion, without frills. When translating desktop designs to mobile, don\u2019t just miniaturize it \u2013 consider how the device and context should influence changes. Other mobile best practices include: Hide and reveal content . Text truncation, \u201cshow more\u201d buttons, and accordion controls increase the scannability of a mobile page, and allow the user to reveal content only on demand. Additionally, menus, headers, and footers can hide when scrolling away, and reveal when scrolling toward \u2013 reclaiming that visual real estate for higher priority elements. Remove unnecessary ornamentation . A beautiful brand image might work on a desktop design (and over reliable wifi), but on mobile is a waste of bandwidth. Keep only those images that orient and communicate critical information \u2013 and optimize those to the viewport of your target devices. Embrace scrolling . The most predictable, responsive, mobile designs translate desktop layouts into long, scrollable pages. Components should be prioritized from top to bottom in a logical linear order, and when possible provide an affordance for the component that follows. Test vigorously ! Minor differences between devices tend to disrupt pixel-precise mobile designs. The most reliable way to assure a predictable user experience is to test on your user\u2019s most common devices, within the browser of that device. If the actual phones / tables are unavailable, device emulators and browser plugins can still remove some of the guesswork. Phone vs. Tablet Differences Remember that a mobile device isn\u2019t just a phone. Scalability across devices, more specifically between a phone and tablet, is a common challenge among designers. While the phone and tablet share many similarities, users use tablets, phones, phablets (not small enough to be a phone, not big enough to be a tablet) very differently. Phone Interfaces Mobile interfaces less than 7 inches width should be treated as a phone. Layout should be aligned across these devices as much as possible, and should also leverage native platform guidelines and capabilities when possible. Mobile phone designs should include only necessary information . The phone is a convenient way to consume information on the go. Airmen use a phone to complete quick actions while they are not at their workspace, capture data in the field, view content, and perhaps return to look later on a larger device. Tablet Interfaces Mobile interfaces greater 7 inches width should be treated as a tablet. Layout should be aligned across these devices as much as possible; they do not need to align to phone interfaces. Tablet designs should look and feel like desktop web, but function like a phone (tap / swipe / hold gestures, etc.). Tablets are more likely to be held in landscape view \u2013 approximating the desktop viewport \u2013 and in this way, many users consider the tablet a hybrid device. \u201cHit Area\u201d and Button Design Unlike the pixel-precise cursor on desktop, mobile interactions rely on human fingers of vastly different sizes. The rule of thumb (!) is that any clickable element should be 48px x 48px (accounting for 2x or greater design if necessary) to accommodate the average fingertip. This hit area should also have adequate padding around it; immediately adjacent clickable elements are not recommended. Native Device Capabilities While most USAF platforms are web-based application viewed within the mobile device browser, native OS design (mobile apps) unlocks the potential of an integrated device. Smart phones and tablets have a lot to offer: touch, voice, pressure, location tracking, accelerometer, notifications, etc. You are designing around the device, the platform, the user experience. How can these device features be utilized in products? How can the mobile device benefit users beyond the screen interface in front of them? When designing for native platforms, however, consistently refer to the native OS design guidelines. These constantly evolve with new version releases and system redesigns, so it\u2019s always good practice to stay on top of these guidelines and refresh your memory and knowledge often.

Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities.\u201d While this might not be a requirement of your particular application\u2019s users, accessibility standards often reflect the most stringent interpretation of contrast, legibility, and usability best practices \u2013 and thus are of use to all designers. Accessibility Tips for Designers Accessible application design is a collaboration between designers and developers, affecting UI and code alike. In the interest of a useful shorthand for this playbook\u2019s primary users, this section focuses on best practices of visual design & accessibility (quoted heavily from the Web Accessibility Initiative): Provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background . Foreground text needs to have sufficient contrast with background colors. This includes text on images, background gradients, buttons, and other elements. Don\u2019t use color alone to convey information . While color can be useful to convey information, color should not be the only way information is conveyed. When using color to differentiate elements, also provide additional identification that does not rely on color perception. For example, use an asterisk in addition to color to indicate required form fields, and use labels to distinguish areas on graphs. Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify . Provide distinct styles for interactive elements, such as links and buttons, to make them easy to identify. For example, change the appearance of links on mouse hover, keyboard focus, and touch-screen activation. Ensure that styles and naming for interactive elements are used consistently throughout the website. Provide clear and consistent navigation options . Ensure that navigation across pages within a website has consistent naming, styling, and positioning. Provide more than one method of website navigation, such as a site search or a site map. Help users understand where they are in a website or page by providing orientation cues, such as breadcrumbs and clear headings. Ensure that form elements include clearly associated labels . Ensure that all fields have a descriptive label adjacent to the field. For left-to-right languages, labels are usually positioned to the left or above the field, except for checkboxes and radio buttons where they are usually to the right. Avoid having too much space between labels and fields. Provide easily identifiable feedback . Provide feedback for interactions, such as confirming form submission, alerting the user when something goes wrong, or notifying the user of changes on the page. Instructions should be easy to identify. Important feedback that requires user action should be presented in a prominent style. Use headings and spacing to group related content . Use whitespace and proximity to make relationships between content more apparent. Style headings to group content, reduce clutter, and make it easier to scan and understand. Create designs for different viewport sizes . Consider how page information is presented in different sized viewports, such as mobile phones or zoomed browser windows. Position and presentation of main elements, such as header and navigation can be changed to make best use of the space. Ensure that text size and line width are set to maximize readability and legibility. Include image and media alternatives in your design . Provide a place in your design for alternatives for images and media. For example, you might need: visible links to transcripts of audio, visible links to audio described versions of videos, text along with icons and graphical buttons, and / or captions and descriptions for tables or complex graphs. Work with content authors and developers to provide alternatives for non-text content. Provide controls for content that starts automatically . Provide visible controls to allow users to stop any animations or auto-playing sound. This applies to carousels, image sliders, background sound, and videos. Most government platforms are subject to the Revised Section 508 Standards and thus WCAG 2.0 Level AA Success Criteria. In addition to other requirements, this will most commonly affect a designer\u2019s text & background color (contrast) choices: Text (including images of text) have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. For text and images of that is at least 24px and normal weight or 19px and bold, use a contrast ratio that is at least 3:1. Color contrast for graphics and interactive UI components must be at least 3:1 so that different parts can be distinguished. When providing custom states for elements (e.g. hover, active, focus), color contrast for those states should be at least 3:1.

Most often, a grid defines a series of equally sized columns with smaller, equally sized columns for padding (\u201cgutters\u201d) in between. The grid behaves differently depending upon the viewport, as defined by the device upon which the layout is viewed. The viewport is essentially the screen size of the device, measured in pixels, and is the amount of visual real estate available for your layout. A thoughtful grid is particularly helpful in responsive design. This type of design is a collaboration with front-end development, and programmatically scales down the layout to be most appropriate for the device / viewport in use. As the browser window shrinks horizontally, the point at which a grid \u201cbreaks\u201d to a fewer-column grid is called the breakpoint. Defining Pixels As device display technology improves, the density of pixels has grown to differ across devices. Names like HD and 4k indicate different numbers of pixels per inch \u2013 all in pursuit of a crisper image. To retain predictability and consistency, designers and developers rely on CSS pixels , which provide a standard definition of pixel size for the web that does not vary based on the device\u2019s pixel density. It is highly recommended that designers work with their front-end developers to define target devices and pixel densities, and use resources that track changing display technology (like https://vizdevices.yesviz.com/ ). Small Viewport The Small Viewport grid is intended to accommodate portrait-view smartphones (approx. 320 px) and many landscape view smartphones. On these devices, the 8-column grid switches to a 4-column structure to create a more comfortable layout on a handheld, as well as to allow for larger tap-targets. This format equates to a maximum width of 767 px , with a minimum width of 320 px . Medium Viewport The Medium Viewport grid is intended to accommodate most portrait-view tablets (768 px), most landscape view phablets (768 px), and larger landscape view smart phones. On these devices, the 12-column grid switches to an 8-column structure to create a more comfortable layout on tablets, as well as to allow for larger tap-targets. This format equates to a maximum width of 1023 px , with a minimum width of 768 px . Large Viewport The Large Viewport grid is intended to accommodate high-resolution monitors, most landscape-view tablets (1042 px), and everything in between. This equates to a maximum width that is infinite , and a minimum width of 1024 px . Responsive Component Reordering As responsive layouts break to smaller viewports, page elements \u2013 components \u2013 should logically reorder and stack vertically to maintain the intent of the layout. This diagram illustrates one solution for component reorganization with respect to responsive layouts. Each component is designed to occupy a minimum of 2 columns and maximum of 6. The Medium Viewport layout includes a potential for additional white space to appear, in the event that a design contains a 3-component row. Being that the use-case is relatively obscure (with respect to hardware, UI, content, and user needs), the choice was made to include the layout as described, thus avoiding either bespoke solutions or arbitrary hierarchical relationships. As a takeaway, design with a minimum of 4 columns / 1 component width for the smallest viewport, and otherwise subdivide the total number of grid columns evenly to create a consistent layout on table and desktop.

If typography is done well, it goes unnoticed. If it\u2019s not, it sticks out like a sore thumb and moreover disrupts the user experience. Typography holds an important place in any form of design that features text, and this is especially true for web and application design. Three Fundamental Aspects of Typography Although in a non-technical sense \u201clegible\u201d and \u201creadable\u201d are often used synonymously, typographically they are separate but related concepts. Legibility is the ease with which a reader can recognize individual characters in text. Readability is the ease with which a reader can recognize words, sentences, and paragraphs comprised of characters. Aesthetics is the emotional property of the text, communicating everything from precision to speed to humor. Typography as an art is nuanced; our primary concern is functional \u2013 the fluid communication of information by the written word. As such, we focus on core concepts for achieving legibility, readability, and context-appropriate aesthetics. Font Type Of the many font categorizations, the two largest (and most common categories) are \u201cserif\u201d and \u201csans-serif\u201d fonts (literally translating to \u201cfeet\u201d and \u201cwithout feet\u201d). The \u201cfeet\u201d to which they refer are the small visual elements that branch out at the end of a stroke. Due to their clean-line, technical appearance, sans-serif fonts are often considered a more modern aesthetic. They are appropriate for both headline and body copy; when used as headlines they often pair well with serif body copy. Due to their origins in mechanical letterpress, serif fonts are often considered a more timeless aesthetic. Studies have shown larger blocks of copy to be more readable when printed in serif type, which is why most books and long-form copy employ serif fonts to this day. Font Size Font size is another major determinant of text readability. A font size of about 16px is optimal for easy online reading of long-form content. To support overall visual hierarchy, consider using three or fewer different font sizes in any given component, Rules on minimum font size can be found on the Accessibility section. Contrast Color contrast ultimately determines whether or not text is readable. Black text on a white background, for example, is very high contrast, but for optimum readability, place very dark grey text on a white background; it will maximize contrast while lowering eye strain. The rules of contrast are outlined specifically in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, addressed elsewhere in this playbook. Depending upon accessibility requirements for the visually impaired, contrast compliance may need to be more or less strictly followed. Hierarchy Text hierarchy becomes especially important in web and application design because it helps users navigate through a site quickly and scan text easily. If all type was the same size and weight, it would be difficult to know which was the most important information on the page. In order to orient the user to critical layout components, headings are usually the most dominant, sub-headings less so, and body type even less so. This hierarchy is accomplished through a combination of font size (px), contrast (color), and weight (thin, bold). Line Height Line height, or leading, refers to the space between lines in a body of text. A general rule for readable text is that your leading value should be 125\u2013150% of the font size. Frustratingly, the \u201csingle spacing\u201d default is typically too tight for text on a web page while \u201cdouble spacing\u201d can be so loose that the text no longer looks as though it is part of one unit. Consider adjusting your line height to satisfy this 125\u2013150% rule. Line Length Line length defines the number of characters in a single line of text, until the reader returns to the beginning of the following line. In large viewports, long lines of body text can be cumbersome to consume. A best practice for body text is a single line character length of 50-60 characters, beyond which diminishes the readability of text. White Space Your layout\u2019s \u201cwhite space\u201d \u2013 visual areas unoccupied by text or images \u2013 is essential for offsetting large amounts of text, and providing focus and orientation for users. It should offer separation between different elements of the text layout, such as text and images, and body text and headers.

These components are called \u201ccontent modules,\u201d and can be used individually or stacked to create long-form content. Your application will likely feature content modules specific to the style of your platform. For the sake of consistency and efficiency, first try re-purposing an existing design solution. Should one not exist within your style guide or front-end code, the following examples act as a guide for designing new components. Full-Width Content Modules Full-width content modules span the width of the viewport at any breakpoint, split and stack as the layout responds down. Particularly in the mobile viewport, these modules should follow best practices of content reordering (section 4.6) and degradation of individual elements like images, nav elements, and longer copy blocks (section 4.12) . Global Navigation (See section 5.2) Branded Header A header for major content categories (generally those items featured in top-level navigation); generally reserved for more editorial (and less functional) pages. Can support large calls-to-action that drive to elsewhere on the page, or other pages entirely. Inline Introduction / Search Combining both introductory text and a search element, this component is useful for guiding the user through long-form content (articles, FAQs, etc.) via search. Content Block: Short Form Copy A simple inline content block supporting short-form copy, branded images, and a call-to-action. Content Block: Video A simple inline content block supporting quoted text and a video player; the video can play either inline or within a modal. Content Block: Brand Call Out A simple inline content block supporting brand taglines, images, and a call-to-action. Content Block: Headline and Image This variant on Editorial Block A introduces a headline element; useful for linking to articles and major content sections, or employing near the top of the layout in lieu of a branded header. Content Block: Number/Bullet List Another variant on Editorial Block A refactors the copy to support a numbered or bulleted list. Inline links provide additional details without disrupting the sequence of content. Content Block: Image Carousel Appropriate for galleries of five or fewer images, this inline carousel can rotate automatically after a few seconds, or based on user click. Content Block: Data Visualization A chart, table, or graph \u2013 in part or whole \u2013 featuring either inline interactivity or a call-to-action linking to the interactive data. Dependent upon your application, this module may exist within a summary article or on an \u201cdashboard\u201d view. Content Block: Data Callout \u201cBig idea\u201d callouts focus on important, singular data points and support headlines, body copy, and branded images; useful for providing an executive view into data without overwhelming with data visualizations. Global Footer (see section 5.2) Half-Width (2-Up) Content Modules Half-width (or 2-up) content modules split the viewport down the middle, and are useful for shorter-form content, callouts, and links to other pages / sections. They are to be avoided in the mobile viewport, were instead they span full-width. Copy 2-Up This simple copy module supports short-form text and a call-to action; given its visual dominance it is appropriate for content of lower priority. Image 2-Up A simple static element supporting an image, caption / body copy, and call-to-action. Can also support inline animation or video.

Navigation One of the most common differences in mobile UI is the navigation, which is most commonly collapsed into a three-line icon nicknamed the \u201chamburger menu.\u201d While the hamburger treatment may wane in popularity, its intent to minimize the navigation into an interactive icon remains an important mobile requirement. Other Mobile-Specific Components Certain mobile-specific elements satisfy the best practices of small viewport design, which other leverage the functionality of the phone itself. Below are common examples. Expand and Collapse More Button Call Button Share Full-screen Components Given the small viewport, it is more common in mobile designs to completely overtake the screen with modals, forms, alerts, and error messages that must be dismissed or completed by the user. These should be used sparingly, but are useful for focusing the user\u2019s attention.
