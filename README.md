## Developing

## Theme

This project uses a custom theme, `bes-theme`. It is based off of the [readthedocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/tree/master/mkdocs/themes/readthedocs) theme.

All of the css and js was removed from that project. The template files have been modified to suit this project. There are many vestigial items left in these templates unfortunately. Cleaning these templates should be looked at if this playbook is revisited.

### Branches

- `master` Final work for release
- `develop` Work in progress
- `gh-pages` Branch generated by MkDocs for deploying on GitHub. Do not check out or edit!


### TODO

- Create better base templates so main and home pages can be shared
