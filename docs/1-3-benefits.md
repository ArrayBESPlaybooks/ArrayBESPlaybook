# 1.3 Benefits of UX

While a number of disciplines have long paved the way for User Experience – including cognitive psychology, library science and human-computer interaction (HCI) – the need for organizations to create and adopt this unique discipline arose at the outset of the internet era as society became increasingly dependent on user interfaces to facilitate daily tasks. The aim of this new discipline was to establish more reliable practices and methods to deliver user-centered software solutions, putting aside biases in the way project teams imagine user needs to create a more firm foundation of evidence upon which to base design decisions. The practices and methods offered by the User Experience discipline ultimately help create greater efficiency on the project team while promoting greater effectiveness and satisfaction among end users.

Studies consistently reinforce these benefits. A frequently cited report by IEEE states that:
- 70% of projects fail due to lack of user acceptance
- Investment in User Experience results in 33–50% reduced development time by having better upfront definition of requirements and avoiding rework
- Every dollar invested in UX brings 100 dollars in return

Among the most common factors for project failure are:
- Unrealistic or unarticulated project goals
- Inaccurate estimates of needed resources
- Badly defined system requirements
- Poor communication among customers, developers and users
- Inability to handle the project’s complexity
