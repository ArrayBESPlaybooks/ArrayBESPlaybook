># **2.2** Problem Statement

In April 2016, AF A4 published the “US Air Force Enterprise Logistics Flight Plan v2.0” (ELFP) and in June of 2016 a subordinate document called the “Enterprise Logistics Technology Annex” (ELTA).  This plan and annex describe the “synthesized logistics information” desired future state of US Air Force (AF) Enterprise Logistics in 2035.

The DoD and the AF understand that the use of agile methods hold great value.  On Feb 2, 2017 DoDI 5000.75 “Business Systems Requirements and Acquisition” was published.  This DoDI recognizes the need to rapidly deploy and improve business systems.

The AF Logistics portfolio is comprised of many applications that are in a variety of lifecycle stages.  These applications contain critical business rules and process flows used to support AF missions.  They were generally developed using traditional means by different teams possessing varied skillsets. Applications were created using the functional and technical best practices and paradigms available at the time to support requirements but may now be outdated.  This has resulted in a portfolio of applications where maintaining, improving and extending functionality is extremely difficult, costly, resource intensive and requires long schedules.  

Additionally, the AF has a shortage of true logistics SMEs capable of reinventing AF Logistics.  Using traditional AF functional improvement methods, these valuable SMEs spend a lot of time on mundane activities that are not really aligned with truly transforming the business.
