># **2.1** Introduction

In April 2016, Air Force (AF) Logistics (A4) published the “US Air Force Enterprise Logistics Flight Plan v2.0” (ELFP) and in June of 2016 a subordinate document called the “Enterprise Logistics Technology Annex” (ELTA).  This plan and annex describe the “synthesized logistics information” future state of AF Enterprise Logistics in 2035.  To maintain a path and schedule that will achieve those long-term goals, a series of enabling initiatives was defined to accelerate current progress to achieve the necessary near-term milestones.  “Enterprise Logistics IT (ELIT) Automated Application Modernization Playbook Chapter” is one of these initiatives.

Automated Application Modernization applies automated tools to transform proprietary, closed legacy applications and systems to modernized applications, aligned with current AF standards hosted on open platforms that are much easier to technically integrate and interoperate with other authorized applications.  Further, the modernized application is more secure, easier to upgrade, componentize, functionally modernize, share information, use third party products (such as reporting tools), and less expensive to maintain and operate.  The Automated Application Modernization Playbook Chapter will provide the Air Force (AF) with approaches and methodologies to convert, transform, and migrate legacy systems to modern, open, standards-based platforms using common languages such as Java and Microsoft .NET.  

For example, the modernization of the AF Logistics Standard Base Supply System (SBSS), that provided a major set of application functionality for Integrated Logistics System – Supply (ILS-S), was converted from a UNISYS 2200-based COBOL application to a well-designed RHEL-based Java application.  This project provided many benefits including: cost reduction, technical improvements, improved user experience, and improved mission integration.  This Playbook Chapter leverages this experience, and others, to create a set of plays that can be applied to modernize a wide variety of applications.
