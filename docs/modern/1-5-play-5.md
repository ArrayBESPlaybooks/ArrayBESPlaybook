># **1.5** Play 5: Formulate the application modernization and migration plan (how to move from “As-Is” to “To-Be” state)

This play develops the plan for migrating the application from the legacy (determined in Play 2) to modernized (determined in Play 3, 4) state using automated tools.

## Checklist
- Create a work plan and project schedule to perform the technical modernization tasks discussed in Play 4.  Choose the best project methodology for the unique requirements of this project (ie: agile, DAD, waterfall, etc; note: hybrid models such as DAD have been used with success within DoD).
- Develop a risk management plan.  Identify and manage risks.

## Key Questions
- Is this plan realistic?  Have all tasks been scoped and bounded with success (done) criteria?
- What is the basis of estimate?
- What are the key execution risks?  How are they being mitigated?  How are they reported to stakeholders?
- How will status be collected and communicated to stakeholders?
- Has management reserve / margin been properly added to the plan?
