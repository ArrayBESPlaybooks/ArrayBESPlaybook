># **2.2** Problem Statement

The AF has many legacy and outdated systems that collectively are comprised of tens of millions of source lines of code (SLOC).  Many of these legacy and outdated systems are on “closed” platforms that prevent the functionality and data contained within the system from being readily being accessed, integrated or interoperated with, extended or improved.  These systems contain business-critical business rules and data that drive the AF and support numerous missions.  This functionality and data need to be unlocked so it can be shared with the other AF applications to improve business and mission effectiveness.  Other issues with the AF’s legacy applications and systems include: poor cyber posture, current platform and language limitations, poor user experiences and user interfaces, poor performance, difficult to find labor skills, expensive platforms and hosting.
