> # **3.4** Phase 2: Conceptual Design

Once the research and discovery work has provided a clear understanding of the problem space and your target users, the next step is translating those insights into a range of testable concepts for a system architecture and initial, low-fidelity interface designs; validating and honing in on the most successful concepts (eventually narrowing to the single best concept); and finally devising a workable strategy for implementation of the selected direction.
