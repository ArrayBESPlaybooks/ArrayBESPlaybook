> # **3.4** Phase 2: Conceptual Design

Once the research and discovery work has provided a clear understanding of the problem space and your target users, the next step is translating those insights into a range of testable concepts for a system architecture and initial, low-fidelity interface designs; validating and honing in on the most successful concepts (eventually narrowing to the single best concept); and finally devising a workable strategy for implementation of the selected direction.

## 3.4.1 Activities for Conceptual Design

#### [Wireframing/sketching](3-4-1-1-wireframe.md)

Using quick, low-fidelity drawings helps explore a broader range of potential solutions in less time.

#### [Information architecture](3-4-1-2-ia.md)

Create an organizational structure for your systemâ€™s features and content in ways that are most meaningful to your users.

#### [Participatory design](3-4-1-3-participatory.md)

Collaborating on initial design with subject matter experts and end users reduces risk and rework.

#### [Concept testing](3-4-1-4-concept.md)

Test early concepts with actual users to gauge effectiveness.

## 3.4.2 Methods for Strategic Planning

#### [Roadmapping](3-4-2-1-roadmapping.md)

A strategic roadmap provides the team alignment on a plan for implementation.

#### [Story writing](3-4-2-2-story.md)

Break up requirements and conceptual designs into discrete, independently executable pieces.
