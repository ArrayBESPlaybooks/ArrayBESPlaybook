> # **3.5** Phase 3: Detailed Design

This phase involves building out the conceptual design into fully detailed designs that encompass the entirety of the interfaces and interactions within a given scope of requirements. The final product should be development-ready, including enough specification to explain the how the user may interact with dynamic portions of the designs, and how the designs satisfy their intended requirements or user stories.

## 3.5.1 Activities for Detailing Designs

### [High-fidelity wireframing and visual design](3-5-1-1-visualdesign.md)

Fully detailed renderings of the systemâ€™s relevant interfaces help clearly articulate the system and its capabilities.

### [Prototyping](3-5-1-2-prototyping.md)

A simulation of the intended presentation and functionality of the system allows user validation prior to committing to build, and demonstrates this intended functionality to the development team.

### [Usability testing](3-5-1-3-usability.md)

Assessing the detailed design at this stage allows the team to more nimbly correct course and enhance the experience prior to development.

### [Specifying/annotating](3-5-1-4-annotating.md)

Provide additional details to the development team to explain all of the ways a user can interact with the designs.
