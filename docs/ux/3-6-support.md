> # **3.6** Phase 4: Support

User experience involvement should not end at a hand-off to the development team. Continuing to participate in the development, deployment and post-delivery support periods is crucial to ensuring the delivered experience matches the delivered designs and meets stakeholder and end-user expectations.

## 3.6.1 Activities in Post-Delivery Support

#### Developer communication and design adjustment

Collaboration with the development team during build helps cover missed edge cases or ambiguous requirements, and ensures that detailed designs are built as specified.

#### Acceptance testing

The product ownership team, including the user experience team, should thoroughly test the built capabilities prior to live deployment. The acceptance criteria collected in [user stories](3-4-2-2-story.md) serve well as an ad hoc test script. Post-launch, conducting acceptance testing with actual end users serves as another validation of the releaseâ€™s designs as well as research for future iterations or new additional features.
