> # **5.9** Key Mobile Components

## Mobile Requires Unique UI

The small viewport and native operating systems of mobile devices require unique design considerations and, accordingly, unique UI elements. This section outlines the key components that differ from tablet / desktop, and their most common applications. For additional guidance on the theory and practice of designing for mobile, refer to elsewhere in this playbook: Key Mobile Standards and Content Modules.

## Considerations & Best Practices

As a reminder, the core consideration of the mobile context is that the device is in-hand and the user is on-the-go. When translating desktop designs to mobile, don’t just miniaturize it – consider how the device and context should influence changes.

Additionally, mobile designs should

- Hide and reveal content.
- Remove unnecessary ornamentation. 
- Embrace scrolling. 
- Be tested vigorously!

## Navigation

One of the most common differences in mobile UI is the navigation, which is most commonly collapsed into a three-line icon nicknamed the “hamburger menu.” While the hamburger treatment may wane in popularity, its intent to minimize the navigation into an interactive icon remains an important mobile requirement.

## Other Mobile-Specific Components

One of the most common differences in mobile UI is the navigation, which is most commonly collapsed into a three-line icon nicknamed the “hamburger menu.” While the hamburger treatment may wane in popularity, its intent to minimize the navigation into an interactive icon remains an important mobile requirement.

## Full-screen Components

Given the small viewport, it is more common in mobile designs to completely overtake the screen with modals, forms, alerts, and error messages that must be dismissed or completed by the user. These should be used sparingly, but are useful for focusing the user’s attention.

## Accommodating OS Native Elements

When designing components, consider any native OS elements that may be triggered by interacting with the component. For instance, an open text field will trigger the appearance of the native keyboard, potentially obscuring the component and resulting in a frustrating user experience.

## Alpha Standard

The following mobile components illustrate the best practices outlined previously, with the practical choices that make it so.
