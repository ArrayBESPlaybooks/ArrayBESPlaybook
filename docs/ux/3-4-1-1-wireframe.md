# 3.4.1.1 Wireframing/Sketching

Low-fidelity wireframing or sketching is a method for quickly translating requirements into interface designs by using simple line drawings to depict the interface. The low fidelity is a feature, as it helps signify the design is in its early stages, and that adjusting to feedback at this stage is still very low-effort and anticipated.


## Product/output

At the initial stage, the wireframes or sketches need only be detailed enough to communicate their intent. The larger goal is to  explore a range of possibilities, not to explore the nuances of any single possibility.
