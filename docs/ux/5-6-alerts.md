> # **5.6** Alerts & Messaging

## USAF Application Styles

Alerts & messaging are specific to applications, though their triggers, appearance, and behaviors should follow 
best practices.



## Alpha Standard

The following example component illustrates the best practices outlined previously, with the practical choices that make it so.

- **Clear**. Alerts state in clear language, and with obvious color cues that they are positive / negative / neutral, the reason for the alert, and the action required of the user in order to resolve it.
- **Consistent**. Alerts follow web or application-standard patterns that are repeating and predictable. If a user were to perform the same triggering action twice, they would receive the same alert twice.
- **Actionable**. Alerts & messages offer clear next steps to resolve or address them. When appropriate to the context, alter text offers inline links, or anchor links to the offending component.

**Disclaimer**: Please default to your applicationâ€™s and USAF styles; the following component standards are to be used only if those assets are not applicable or not available
