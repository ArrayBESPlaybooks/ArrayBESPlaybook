> # **5.7** Forms & Controls

Form controls are specific to applications, though their triggers, appearance, and behaviors should follow best practices (see Buttons & Controls in section 4.11). Note that many form controls are defined by the user’s browser, and thus should be presumed to default to that design.

## Alpha Standard

The following example component illustrates the best practices outlined previously, with the practical choices that make it so.

- **Looks interactive**. Controls are differentiated from “passive” content by their label, form factor, and/or use of the design system’s call-to-action color.
- **Proximity**. Controls are placed logically near the form or element they are intended to affect. For instance, a “SUBMIT” button lives at the bottom of the related text field.
- **Predictable**. Context, form label, and control label give the user a clear understanding of what will occur when they’ve interacted with the component.

**Disclaimer**: Please default to your application’s and USAF styles; the following component standards are to be used only if those assets are not applicable or not available
