# 3.3.2.4 Diary Studies

In this method, study participants are asked to keep a diary and log specific information over time about activities being studied. The diary itself can range from a simple paper journal to a digital recording device, and the input to be collected in the log entries can range from highly structured responses (like duration of the activity in seconds) to open-ended responses like detailed depictions of thoughts or emotions.

## When to use

Use to collect qualitative data about user behaviors, activities and experiences over time, especially when [field study](3-3-1-2-surveys.md) or “shadowing” is not possible, such as when the duration of the activities to be studied is longer than a day or two, or involves the user traveling to multiple geographic locations, or requires round-the-clock monitoring.

## Requirements

- Access to actual end users who are willing to earnestly and accurately report their own thoughts and actions.
- A means of collecting diaries at the end of the reporting period.

## Product/output

Depending on the types of input your study requested of its participants, the diary entries can be decomposed and categorized or aggregated into quantitative measures to inform and support personas, or can be used for qualitative inputs to populate [personas](3-3-2-1-personas.md), [user scenarios](3-3-2-2-scenarios.md), [journey maps](3-3-2-3-journey.md) and [service design blueprints](3-3-2-4-blueprints.md).
