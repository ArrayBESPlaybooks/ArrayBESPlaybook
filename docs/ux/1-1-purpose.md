> # **1.1** Purpose

This User Experience Playbook is a continuation of effort by the BES PEO to establish modern practices and methods to accelerate software development and deployment of value for Logistics Information Systems and its end users. Preceded by playbooks for Agile and Automated Testing, the User Experience playbook aims to define a framework for how to plan and structure projects to include User Experience (UX) in both Agile and Waterfall environments, describing each stage of the process including key activities and deliverables as well as their benefits.

Furthermore, this playbook aims to establish core User Experience design principles unique to the mission of Logistics Information Systems, as well as Web and Component Design Standards to create a more unified and consistent digital presence while enabling more rapid planning and deployment of future digital initiatives. These Web and Component Design Standards will include guidelines for typography, color and other style parameters in addition to reusable design patterns for common components such as navigation, buttons, alerts and form controls.

The User Experience Playbook will serve as a “living document,” delivering value in the present while providing a foundation for future updates and enhancements as the state of technology and the needs of stakeholders and users served by Logistics Information Systems continually evolve. 

For those seeking further resources and materials to help you advance along the path the understanding User Experience practices and methods, please see the [Resources](6-1-appendix.md) page within the Appendix.
